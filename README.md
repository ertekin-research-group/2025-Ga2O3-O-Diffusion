# 2025-Ga2O3-O-Diffusion

This repository hosts the generated and analyzed data for the study of 'Investigation of O interstitial diffusion in β-Ga2O3: a direct approach via master diffusion equations'. It contains detailed atomic structures and diffusion paths, highlighting the role of intrinsic defects in O self-diffusion in β-Ga2O3.

## Repository Contents

### A) POSCAR Files for Defect Structures

- **A1) Neutral O Interstitial Library:** Atomic structures of neutral (q=0) O interstitials in POSCAR format (`.vasp` files).
- **A2) Charged O Interstitial Library:** Atomic structures of charged (q=2-) O interstitials in POSCAR format (`.vasp` files).

### B) NEB Calculations for Principal Hops

- **B1) Neutral O Interstitial Network Principal Hops:** POSCAR files of intermediate structures from NEB calculations for principal hops of the neutral (q=0) O interstitial diffusion network between defect states in A1. These hops are fundamental diffusion paths that cannot be further decomposed into multiple shorter hops.
- **B2) Charged O Interstitial Network Principal Hops:** Similar to B1, but for charged (q=2-) O interstitials, connecting defect states from A2. 

## Usage
This data is intended to support the findings of our study on O diffusion in β-Ga2O3. Researchers can utilize these libraries and networks to further understand the diffusion mechanisms or to compare with other computational or experimental studies.
